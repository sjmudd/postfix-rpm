TODO List for Postfix Packages
------------------------------

This is a list of mine, of things which perhaps I should do to improve the
Postfix RPM I produce.  If you want to suggest other improvements let me
know by email to Simon J Mudd <sjmudd@pobox.com>.

- When building with TLS or SASL support adapt Postfix configuration
  accordingly. Setup the TLS/SASL environment so that the user does not
  need to study the docs as much.

- Modify buildpackage (from my cvs repository) used to build the packages
  - download more of the patches if they don't exist in my cvs repository
  - test more of the patches so that I know which patches currently don't
    apply cleanly
