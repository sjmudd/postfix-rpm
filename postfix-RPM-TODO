TODO List for Postfix-2 Packages
--------------------------------

This is a list of mine, of things which perhaps I should do to improve the
Postfix RPM I produce.  If you want to suggest other improvements let me
know by email to Simon J Mudd <sjmudd@pobox.com>

- Change %prep part of postfix.spec.in to not build if using a spec file
  generated for a distribution other than the distribution which is being
  used

- When building with TLS or SASL support adapt Postfix configuration
  accordingly. Perhaps setup the TLS/SASL environment so that the user
  doesn't need to study the docs so much

- Check whether there are problems with SASL 2 libraries. I haven't
  modified the SASL build environment to distinguish between SASL v1 and
  v2 libraries.  I have not received problem reports so I _guess_ that
  all is working ok. If not let me know.
