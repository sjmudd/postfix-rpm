TODO List for Postfix Packages
------------------------------

This is a list of mine, of things which perhaps I should do to improve the
Postfix RPM I produce.  If you want to suggest other improvements let me
know by email to Simon J Mudd <sjmudd@pobox.com>

- When building with TLS or SASL support adapt Postfix configuration
  accordingly. Perhaps setup the TLS/SASL environment so that the user
  doesn't need to study the docs so much

- Check whether there are problems with SASL 2 libraries. I haven't
  modified the SASL build environment to distinguish between SASL v1 and
  v2 libraries.  I have not received problem reports so I _guess_ that
  all is working ok. If not let me know.

- Modify buildpackage (from my cvs repository) used to build the packages
  - download more of the patches if they don't exist in my cvs repository
  - test more of the patches so that I know which patches currently don't
    apply cleanly
