         A mailing list to announce updates to my packages
         =================================================

If you are interested in being kept up to date of the latest postfix
RPM packages I produce you can subscribe to a mailing list setup for
this purpose.

I announce new packages as they are updated, and or changes which have
been made, either following newer releases by Wietse, or as I update
the packages due to suggestions I receive from users.

These announcements are not sent to the postfix-users mailing list as
a large number of users on that list are not Linux users: for them the
announcements would be rather off-topic.

To subscribe to the list: send a message with the text "subscribe
postfix-rpm-announce" to majordomo@WL0.org

A searchable version of the contents of the list is also available on
the web at the following URL:
