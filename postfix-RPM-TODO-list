Please consider adding a symlink /usr/lib/sendmail -> /usr/sbin/sendmail
for the historic compatibility sake...

Comments:
---------
I don't want to do this.  Applications following FHS should not use this 
directory for the path.  Fix the application and tell the author.

Date:		on various occasions.
Status:		PENDING
Problem:
--------
I want postfix+pcre, postfix+tls, postfix+mysql etc.

Comments:
---------
I haven't yet found an easy way to build multiple packages from
one single spec file.  If you find out how, let me know.

Using several spec files is ugly and the only other way I can think
of doing this is to have a spec file in ./SOURCES which together with
a make file allows a specific package to be built, while maintaining
the the ability to generate the other packages from the appropriate
source package.

Problem:
--------
- compile & include smtp-source/sink and generate the manpages for them
- include my mynetworks patch if Wietse doesn't get clue on that :-]

postfix user/group required to build package.  Create them if needed on
package build.

Reported by:	Daniel Roesen <droesen@entire-systems.com>

Status:		Partly complete in 20001212-2, part PENDING
Problem:
--------
include smtp-source/sink, but PENDING including man pages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reported by:	Daniel Roesen <droesen@entire-systems.com> 
Date:		07/12/2000
Status:		Complete in 20001212-2 if option is enabled when building
Problem:
--------
Include my mynetworks patch if Wietse doesn't get clue on that.

Comments:
---------
To include Daniel's patch before building from the source package do the
following:
 # export POSTFIX_SAFE_MYNETWORKS=1
 # rpm -ba postfix.spec # to build the package

NOTE: The version I build includes this patch
