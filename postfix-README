Information related to the Postfix packages I build
---------------------------------------------------

The postfix packages were built on redhat-6.2 and haven't been tested on
other redhat releases.

These packages won't work on redhat 5.x due to library dependency problems.
I think that all that is needed to build redhat 5.x packages is to follow
the following steps:

1. download source rpm package: postfix.....src.rpm
2. install it (this doesn't affect the binary packages that are installed):
	rpm -Uvh postfix...src.rpm
   this puts files in /usr/src/redhat/ ready to build a package
3. build the binary rpms (locally)
	cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	rpm -ba postfix.spec
   The binary and source rpms are put in
	/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and
	/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS respectively
4. install the binary rpms
	rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/postfix...i386.rpm

If you have any further questions regarding this package please let me know.
Package building errors are mine alone, and not Wietse's.

Alternative rpms are available.
	Redhat
		seem to have some somewhere, though I can't find a URL
	cloud9.net
		seem to have some too
	moongroup.com
		seem to have some too

It would be nice if there were one "good" redhat rpm for postfix, but that
doesn't appear to be the case at the moment.  Mine isn't perfect either.
