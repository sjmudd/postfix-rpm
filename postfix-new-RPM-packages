         A mailing list to announce updates to my packages
         =================================================

For those of you interested in being kept up to date of the latest postfix
RPM packages I produce I have setup a mailing list for this purpose.

I simply announce the latest package I've updated, and or changes which
have been made, either following newer releases by Wietse, or as I update
the packages due to suggestions I receive from users.

I don't send these announcements to the postfix-users mailing list as
there are already a large number of users on that list, and probably a
majority do not use RPM or Linux: for them the announcements would be
rather off-topic.

If you are interested in receiving these email announcements, please
subscribe to the list: send a message with the text "subscribe
postfix-rpm-announce" to majordomo@WL0.org

A searchable version of the contents of the list is also available on
the web at the following URL:
