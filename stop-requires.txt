# just in case I need to implement this

%define _use_internal_dependency_generator 0
%define __find_requires %{SOURCE999}

and filter-requires-<foo>.sh does:

#!/bin/sh

/usr/lib/rpm/find-requires "$@" \
  | egrep -v <extended regex of bogus/superfluous dependencies>

(for redhat systems you can also try /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/find-requires)
