README for postfix cvs build environment
========================================

This is the environment that I use to build my Postfix packages:

local user having the following directory structure:

~user/cvs/postfix-rpm	# which I rename to ...
   |      postfix-1.1
   |      postfix-2.0
   |      postfix-2.1
   |      postfix-current
   --/RPM/TMP
          SRC/postfix
          PKG

The cvs directories DO NOT contain the Postfix tar balls.  These are
downloaded on demand by the build script.  The other patches are kept
in the cvs directory and before building are linked to the file in the
SOURCES directory.

Common Makefile targets
-----------------------

setup:
	setup the directory structure indicated above
	You must actually checkout the cvs files you want.
	See http://postfix.WL0.org/en/cvs for details
all:
	same as rpm
rpm:
	build rpm
update:
	update cvs file from cvs server
        this also builds the rpm

clean tidy:
	Clean out the mess: that is remove all symbolic links to the SOURCES directory,
	clean out the BUILD directory

commit:
	commit changes back to the cvs repository (only for cvs writers)
	
As you are reading this file you should have already checked out the postfix-rpm files.
Thus you can run the following command to setup the directory structure.

$ make setup 

After this move your cvs directory to the appropriate place

$ mv postfix-rpm ~/cvs/postfix-2.1

You are now ready to build your RPM
