This repo can be found at http://github.com/sjmudd/postfix-rpm.

The postfix-rpm files are NOT on the master branch, but a branch
whose name is based on the postfix version:

POSTFIX_2_8	postfix-2.8 packages
POSTFIX_2_7	postfix-2.7 packages
POSTFIX_2_6	postfix-2.6 packages
POSTFIX_2_5	postfix-2.5 packages
POSTFIX-2_4	postfix-2.4 packages
...

To see a full list of remote branches try:

# git branch -a

To get onto the right branch simply do

$ git checkout POSTFIX_2_8 # or the appropriate branch

The git repo contains all the history of the rpms I have built with the
original cvs repository information being imported to git.

To build the rpm setup the appropiate POSTFIX_XXXX environment variables
and then type make rpm.
