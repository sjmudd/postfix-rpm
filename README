README for postfix git build environment
========================================

This is the environment that I use to build my Postfix packages:

local user having the following directory structure:

~user/git/postfix-rpm
   |
   --/RPM/TMP
          SRC/postfix
          PKG

The git directory DOES NOT contain the Postfix tar balls.  These are
downloaded on demand by the build script.  The other patches are kept
in the git directory and before building are linked to the file in the
SOURCES directory.

Common Makefile targets
-----------------------

setup:
	setup the directory structure indicated above
	You must actually checkout the git files you want.
	See http://postfix.WL0.org/en/git for details.

all:
	same as rpm

build/rpm:
	build rpm

fetch:
	retrieve the files from their source (if necessary)

update:
	update files from git repository
        this also builds the rpm

clean tidy:
	Clean out the mess: that is remove all symbolic links to the SOURCES directory,
	clean out the BUILD directory

commit:
	commit changes back to the git repository (only for git writers)
	
As you are reading this file you should have already checked out the postfix-rpm files.
Thus you can run the following command to setup the directory structure.

$ make setup 

You are now ready to build your RPM
