    HOW TO RECEIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF CHANGES IN THE RPM PACKAGES I PRODUCE
    =====================================================================

I have set up a private "list" to announce changes in the postfix packages
I write, so that those of you who are interested can be advised of newer
releases I produce.

I plan to simply announce the latest package I've updated, and or changes
which have been made, either following newer releases by Wietse, or as
I update the packages due to suggestions I receive from users.

I could send these announcements to postfix-users, but I think there are
already a large number of users on this list, and probably a majority
do not use rpm or linux, so the announcements are rather off-topic.

If you are interested in receiving an email announcement, please let me
know, sending me a message to my email address: <sjmudd@pobox.com>
